Many SAST (static application security testing) tools attach SARIF (static analysis results interchange format) logs to work items.
To view a SARIF log without this extension, you first download the attachment, then open it in a separate viewer.
With this extension, you can view the SARIF log in context of the work item.

This extension is a lightweight wrapper around the [SARIF Web Component](https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-web-component).
