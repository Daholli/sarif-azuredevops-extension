This extension adds a tab named "Scans" in two locations:

* **Build Result** - Displays any SARIF logs (`*.sarif`) found within the `CodeAnalysisLogs` artifact.
* **Work Item** - Displays any SARIF logs (`*.sarif`) that are attached to the work item.

This extension is a lightweight wrapper around the [SARIF Web Component](https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-web-component).

SARIF is the Static Analysis Results Interchange Format. More information [here](http://sarif.info/).
